# Excel Data Visualization in ASP.NET MVC

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to convert Excel sheet data into a SQL Server database and visualize that data using dynamic charts on a website built with **ASP.NET MVC** and **Chart.js**.

Initially, the Excel data was manually imported into the SQL Server database. After that, an MVC-based web application was developed to retrieve and display this data visually. The application supports various chart types, including bar and pie charts, allowing users to interact with and understand the data more effectively.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET MVC** (.NET Framework)
- **SQL Server** (Relational Database)
- **Chart.js** (JavaScript Charting Library)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **ADO.NET / Entity Framework** (Database Connection)

## 🚀 Features

- Import data from Excel into SQL database manually
- Display database records on a web page
- Visualize data using:
  - 📊 Bar Chart
- Interactive and dynamic chart rendering using Chart.js

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Controllers/` – Handles logic and API endpoints
- `Models/` – Represents data structures
- `Views/` – Razor pages for frontend rendering
- `Scripts/Chart.js` – Chart rendering library integration
- `App_Data/` – (Optional) Contains sample Excel/SQL files for testing
